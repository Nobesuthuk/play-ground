        It is not worth it to <em>secrefice</em> your time for <b>TEMPORAL</b> high.<br>
        Once you shift your focus to things that do not matter you forget or slack on important thing.<br> People get distracted very easily 
        I am currently working on myself and it is not easy .At this age we are playing catch up. It is a dangarouse game i must say<br>
        Having to jugle between work , financial difficulties , family , school and Mjolo ayy noo.<br> I often find myself getting distracted
        by temporal high.
